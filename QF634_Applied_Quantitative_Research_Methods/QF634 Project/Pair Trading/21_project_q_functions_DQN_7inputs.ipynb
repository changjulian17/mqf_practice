    "# Machine Learning Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Initial evaluation of the baseline portfolio shows that draw downs are small. Originally team had the idea of using Machine Learning to optimise for sizing of these pair trades. However since there was no significant drawdowns the returns are linearly increasing with investment sizing i.e. greater nominal investment in the the pair trade the proportionate increase in returns without realising significant drawdown risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of optimising for sizing, we can explore Machine Learning in terms of strategy on this stationary dataset. Whereas our prescribed strategy is to enter at +/- 1 std dev, exit at 0 with +/- 2 std dev stop loss. These are only suggestions and arbitrary levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Machine Learning, we can discover if it will uncover the mean reverting nature and recommend another threshhold. We use Q Learner to understand state space with the same spread, mid, std dev parameters as the baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "#### Environment:\n",
    "- State Space: A set of all possible states the agent can be in.  \n",
    "  - [spread, mid, 2 sd low, 1 sd low, 1 sd high, 2 sd high]\n",
    "- Action Space: A set of all possible actions the agent can take in each state.   \n",
    "  - [-1, # short\\\n",
    "      0, # uninvested\\\n",
    "      1  # long]   \n",
    "- Reward Function: A function that assigns a numerical reward to each state-action pair, indicating the immediate consequence of taking a particular action in a specific state.\n",
    "  - dailypnl\n",
    "- Transition Function: A function that determines the probability of transitioning from one state to another when a particular action is taken.\n",
    "  - deterministic based on historical performance\n",
    "#### Agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Q-Table: A matrix that stores the estimated Q-values for each state-action pair. Q-values represent the expected future reward for taking a specific action in a given state.   \n",
    "  - continuous Q table?\n",
    "- Learning Rate (α): A parameter that controls how much the Q-values are updated with each new experience.   \n",
    "- Discount Factor (γ): A parameter that determines the importance of future rewards. A higher discount factor gives more weight to future rewards.   \n",
    "- Exploration Rate (ε): A parameter that controls the balance between exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing the action with the highest Q-value).   \n",
    "- Q-Learning Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Initialization: Initialize the Q-table with random values or zeros.   \n",
    "  - Exploration and Exploitation: Use an exploration strategy (e.g., ε-greedy) to choose an action:\n",
    "    - With probability ε, choose a random action.   \n",
    "    - With probability 1-ε, choose the action with the highest Q-value for the current state.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Take Action: Execute the chosen action in the environment.   \n",
    "  - Observe Reward and Next State: Observe the immediate reward and the next state resulting from the action.\n",
    "- Update Q-Value: Update the Q-value of the current state-action pair using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Make indicators and spread stationary around 0\n",
    "Deduct the mean from all values to translate to 0 axis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training and Test set\n",
    "\n",
    "2013 is used for warm start\\\n",
