### QF600 Asset Pricing

#### Homework 1

> QF600_Asset_Pricing/Homework_1/efficient_frontier_notebook.ipynb

- Efficient Frontier
- Tangency Portfolio
  - CAL
  - Sharpe

Interestingly enough I did a stochastic version of this in 2021, while I was studying Machine Learning at General Assembl as a study into mathematical analysis of portfolio construction. It was also my [first medium article](https://medium.com/@changjulian17/modern-portfolio-theory-with-python-f33c9f517cd4)

In this exercise I found that the theoretical minimum variance portfolio, tangential portfolio can be calculated. I also placed the code in a neat class to make the notebook more readable. Also included the formulas I used. Bold for vectors and matrices.

#### Homework 2

> QF600_Asset_Pricing/Homework_2/Capital_Asset_Pricing_Model_notebook.ipynb

- Market Model
- Security Market Line

Applying principles of market model and CAPM framework

#### Homework 3

> QF600_Asset_Pricing/Homework_3/Linear_Factor_Model_notebook.ipynb

- Linear Factor Models
  - OLS regression of 10 industries
- Performace measurements
  - Sharpe ratio
  - Sortino Ratio
  - Treynor Ratio
  - Jensen's Alpha
  - Fama-French Alpha

Using OLS to obtain market and idiosyncratic risks per Market Model. Also measuring portfolio performance against multiple metrics such as risk-volatility comparisons and absolute alphas in single and multiple factor models.

#### Homework 4

> QF600_Asset_Pricing/Homework_4/Efficient_Frontier_Revisited.ipynb

- Reused Efficient Frontier with market portfolio as a benchmark return
- Monte Carlo simulations of portfolios to plot efficient frontier

Instead of only using Risk-free rate as in Homework 1, used Market Portfolio to compare relative performance and volatility of portfolios. In the second part, obtained an estimate for the minimum variance portfolio by computing returns and variance for random portfolios using Monte Carlo method. Showing that we can obtain a wider range of portfolios by taking the reciprocal of the random weights.
