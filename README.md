- Efficient Frontier
- Tangency Portfolio
    - CAL
    - Sharpe

Interestingly enough I did a stochastic version of this in 2021, while I was studying Machine Learning at General Assembl as a study into mathematical analysis of portfolio construction. It was also my [first medium article](https://medium.com/@changjulian17/modern-portfolio-theory-with-python-f33c9f517cd4)

In this exercise I found that the theoretical minimum variance portfolio, tangential portfolio can be calculated. I also placed the code in a neat class to make the notebook more readable. Also included the formulas I used. Bold for vectors and matrices.
